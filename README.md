# hackholyoke-project

Welcome! We are excited that you are here. This repository is utitlized for Afsaana's and my HackHolyoke project, Number Nest! (This is just a name idea I threw out there, we can change it whenever).

The basic idea of this learning game is that you, the player (bird), flies around to collect numbers for your nest. Each cloud you come upon will have a new number or additive symbol (such as the +, x, or ^ (for whole, positive exponents)). These numbers will ultimately add, multiply, or exponentially increase your points.
But beware of rain!!! Any time you are hit by the rain (in the form of - or /) you will lose points based on the last number you collected!
